## The Kittenblock Graphical programming software

Your experience is just the tip of the iceberg. The function of the MiniLFR does not stop there. It differs from toy cars on the market. Its charm lies in its ability to control various sensors on the car through autonomous graphical programming.

All Kittenbot products can be programmed via Kittenblock. Kittenblock is developed over the latest MIT scratch3.0 codebase and focus on hardware interacting. Kittenblock is designed for primary and secondary school programming education and personal enthusiasts DIY projects. We break the barrier between software and hardware by graphical programming.

**Features: low entry level, Get started quickly and understand it easily.**

The following picture shows the interface of Kittenblock. Kittenblock is based on Scratch3.0, the UI is visually very different from the Scratch2.0. 
The UI is brighter, more vibrant, and more consistent with the tone of young people learning. It is a graphical software that has a good experience in the market and supports the most electronic devices.
